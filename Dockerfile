# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# The Telegram transport for assistant-hub-swarm. One process, one HTTP port, no
# database, no migrations, no volumes — it registers with a core at boot and
# reconciles from the desired state the core answers with.
#
#   docker build --secret id=npm_token,env=NPM_TOKEN -t ahw-transport-telegram .
#
# The SDK comes from GitHub Packages, whose npm registry wants a token on every
# request: a public package there is readable by any account, but not
# anonymously. So the build takes one as a BuildKit secret — never a build arg,
# never a layer. Any token with `read:packages` will do; in CI it is the
# workflow's own GITHUB_TOKEN.
#
# It runs from TypeScript source via tsx: the entrypoint uses top-level await,
# and a compile step would buy nothing here but a second module resolution to
# keep correct.

# in for image normalization), which `npm ci`'s strict sync check rejects.
#
# The committed `.npmrc` carries the scope; the token is appended from the
# secret and the file is deleted inside the same layer, so nothing about it is
# recoverable from the image.
